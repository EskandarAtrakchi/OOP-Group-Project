4. **Testing:** Rigorous testing for functionality and reliability.
5. **Deployment:** Launching the software for user access and support.
6. **Maintenance and Updates:** Ongoing support and periodic updates based on user feedback.

## Budget:
We estimate that the project will require the time of the three of us to meet at NCIâ€™s library for a minimum of 6 hours per week for the development, testing, and deployment of HealthConnect.

## Timeline:
The project is anticipated to be completed before the submission date.
