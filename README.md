Project Title: "HealthConnect: A Comprehensive Health and Well-Being Management System"

This document is a proposal for Health and Well-Being, we believe that this project has the potential to change the world and for better health and well-being.

Project Overview

Objective:
The main objective of this software management system is to develop a comprehensive HealthConnect that aims to address many aspects of good health, including physical fitness, mental health, nutrition, hospitals, and access to healthcare resources.

Key Features:
Eskandar Atrakchi
A glance and comparison between African, Middle Eastern, and European healthcare systems and try to standardize a perfect healthcare system. 
Users can create their own profiles, they can log in at any time, and first and second security layer features will be implemented to make sure that the data accessed by the user belongs to the user.
Users can book an appointment and check search for an available appointment, and what doctors are available for their needs. Users can delete appointments that they have booked and also search for an appointment that they have booked.
Users can have Electrical Healthcare Records (EHR) can be checked by the users and by their doctor will also help to check the history of the patients. Users can search for their electronic healthcare records and delete them.

I will solve the section on how individuals take care of their health using physical fitness and nutrition(food) which means that the code might include what type of physical exercises and nutrition would be recommended depending on the gender, age, weight height, and activity level, then depend on the result user provided how many days the exercises needed to achieve a good health level without any side effects that might come with the physical exercise. So, I will have to create one main class one parent class, and two child classes that will be inherited from the parent class I will have three or more features.

Followed Methodology:
1. Requirements Analysis: Gather the requirements through a group discussion in NCI’s library.
2. System Design: Create a detailed system architecture using object-oriented design principles.
3. Development: Implement the system using object-oriented programming languages and best practices.
4. Testing: Rigorous testing to ensure the system's functionality and reliability.
5. Deployment: Launch the software for user access and support.
6. Maintenance and Updates:  Provide ongoing support and periodic updates based on user feedback.


Budget:
We estimate that the project will require the time of the three of us to meet at the NCI’s library for a minimum of 6 hours per week for the development, testing, and deployment of HealthConnect.

Timeline:
The project is anticipated to be completed before the submission date.
